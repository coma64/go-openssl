supported any more we need to support our version for usage in the Golang
connector `tarantool/go-tarantool`.

See [releases of `libp2p/openssl`](https://github.com/libp2p/go-openssl/releases)
for previous changes history.

- Build with OpenSSL < 1.1.1 (#7).
- Build on macOS as a static library (#8).

- Random errors in the code caused by an invalid OpenSSL error handling in
  LoadPrivateKeyFromPEM, LoadPrivateKeyFromPEMWithPassword,
  LoadPrivateKeyFromDER and LoadPublicKeyFromPEM (#9).
